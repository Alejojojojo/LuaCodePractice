Goal: 
	Create a function that takes two strings.
	Have the function print both strings together with a space separating them.
	Have the function yield for 0.5 seconds.
	Then have the function print both strings together, but with both strings reversed.
	Have the function yield again for 0.5 seconds.
	Then have the function print both strings together, but with both captialized
	Then have the function print "finished!"
	
	Call this function 10 times using a for loop
